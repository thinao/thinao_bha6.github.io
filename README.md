# BioHack Academy Github page template

After building and using your lab, the third and most crucial step in becoming a biohacker is sharing your experience with others. For that you'll need a documentation site. Using this template, you will have that site up and running in no time in your own GitHub account!

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of this page.

### Step 2) Rename the repository 

Next, go to the settings tab, and rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io (so remove BHA_DocumentationSite)
It has to be exactly this, otherwise the site won't build. 

Your documentation site be viewable immediately at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 3)

### Step 3) Customize and view your site

Configure your site name, description and url by editing the _config.yml file. 

You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with Jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <http://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. RECOMMENDED: Clone down your repository to your harddrive and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository, using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Here's a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdhuWDdu-rk).
  
### Step 4) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2016-2-23-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just click on **Create new file** in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md (just like **2016-2-23-Hello-World.md** ). Note that posts with a date in the future will not show.

### Step 5) Change the About Pages

Edit `/about.md` to change the information on the About page of your documentation site.
