# Project

## final presentation

### Theme : LIFE CAN BE INFORMATION MATERIAL?
Use microorganism as material and information.

## Previous studies

90 petabytes of data into 41 grams of DNA.

->[Reference](https://www.nature.com/news/synthetic-double-helix-faithfully-stores-shakespeare-s-sonnets-1.12279)

Over five million bits of data were stored and all the DNA files reproduced the information between 99.99% and 100% accuracy encoding the data in a series of overlapping short oligonucleotides.

## Project

### 1. Write down characters and translate data to DNA code


Text unicode data
Coordinate data of handwriting

↓

Binary data 
0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 .....

↓

DNA data
A T T G C C A .....

### 2.Genetically inject DNA data into microbe DNA, and culture them.

**DNA syntehtize**

* Phosphoramidite method
* DNA synthesizer
* Order DNA


**DNA transformation**

1. Create vector with synthetic DNA fragment
2. Transformation by homologous recombination

### 3.Sequencing DNA in microbe and pick out the data
### 4.Regenerate handwriting information
